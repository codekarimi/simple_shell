THIS IS A README FILE FOR THE SIMPLE SHELL GROUP PROJECT MADE BY CLIFFORD KARIMI MURIUKI AND Ndigirigi Gichuhi  FROM KENYA.

THE PROJECT OVERVIEW: WHAT IS A SHELL?

It is a command line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for unix-like operating systems.

BASIC STEPS ON HOW THE SHELL WORKS
The shell displays to the user, indicating that it is ready to accept commands.

The user now enters the a command at the prompt that appears and then presses ENTER.

The shell reads the command and separates it into the command name and arguments.

The shell looks up the command name and it's list of builtin commandsor int the system's list of executable programs.

on this, if the command is a builtin command, the shell executes it directly and if the command is an executable program, the shell creates a new process to run the program.
If the command is an executable program, the shell passes the command name and arguments to exec() system call which replaces the correct process images with the image of the specified program.

After the command has finished executing, the shell displays the out of the command to the user.
